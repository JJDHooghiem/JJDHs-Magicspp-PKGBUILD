# ECMWF magics++ PKGBUILD for my Arch Linux machine 
Original PKGBUILD from Anton Bazhenov and Graziano Giuliani taken from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/magics++.git).
My own build, main changes to the original are 

`pkgver`

to be up to date with the latest version. 

Benefit of the newer version: it does no longer depend on [EMOS](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EMOS/Emoslib), which is now deprecated.
